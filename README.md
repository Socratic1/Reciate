# Reciate (working title)

## Some initial proposals

  - A social network that encourages IRL contact

  - Members join communities

  - Members appreciate the actions of other members of their communities

  Optionally, at the end or beginning of the day/week members can receive a notification with reminders of what they appreciated that day/week.

  - It is important to encourage fun and gratitude, not ego

  Individual members do not have a tally of their received appreciations, but communities have a tally of their collective appreciations.

  Anonymity is very important. Users will be notified when their actions have been appreciated, but will not see that another's action has been appreciated (though the community appreciations will go up).

  Communities do not compete, but will see how their score compares to the past. Are members giving more appreciations this week than last?

  - An 'Ikea' barrier of entry

  Using the various features of the app should not be difficult or inconvenient, but should require enough effort that it isn't meaningless.

  Creating communities should be very easy.

  To join a community may require a QR code or close proximity to someone already in the community.

  To appreciate an action should also require some effort, perhaps a QR code or proximity to where the action was created.

  - We imagine that when you enter a place (a cafe, a school, a work place, etc.) you can optionally be notified of activities done by other members of your communities and of things there to appreciate.

  - The code is open source, so it is important to be mindful of how it can be abused. We ought to legally protect the app against being used for nefarious purposes.

  For example, employers requiring their employees to receive a certain number of appreciations.

  - We consider using a blockchain for data storage, rather than a database.

  We could use event sourcing to record all user interactions, and all users would have a hash of all of the list of all of these records installed locally. It waits to be seen whether the amount of data would make this impractical, but we do not expect to store large amounts of user data.
